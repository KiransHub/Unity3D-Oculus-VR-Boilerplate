Set up your Oculus Quest so that it run's in developer mode.

### Getting Controllers / Hands working
For this to work you need to create an application id the Oculus online developer portal: https://developer.oculus.com/

Register for an account, click manage and create an application. You'll get an application ID.

## Things to note:
I'm currently learning Unity3D and I know that there are a number of dlls etc checked in to source control. I'm not sure if all of these need to be checked in. As I learn more I will exclude and delete them.
